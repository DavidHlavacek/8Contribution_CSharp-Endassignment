## Problem Description

The following rules are operated to calculate the annual contribution to a
sports club: Senior members pay € 150,-, junior members pay € 75,-. Senior
members are people aged 18 or above. Playing members also pay a € 45,-
association contribution. People who have been members for more than 7
years are given a 5% discount on the club contribution.
A program must be developed in which the name, date of birth and date of
joining the club (format ddmmyyy) of each member can be entered, and also
whether the member is a playing or non-playing member. The contribution
of each member must be calculated and shown. The cumulative total contribution, the average number of years of membership and the youngest member
must also be shown.
